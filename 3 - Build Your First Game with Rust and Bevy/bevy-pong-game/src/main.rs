    /*
        This pong game is going to have a program structure with the intention to modularize it so that it has improved organization, maintainability, and scalability

        it will be following the ECS Entity-component-system paradigm

        so first a components.rs file is made that defines ECS components in the game, like player, ball, and paddle.

        These components will be centralized there, making a single place to manage all the data types attached to entities, making it easier to track and modify


        Next, a systems directory is made

        This contains all the individual modules for different systems in the game

        each module handles a specific aspect of the game logic, ensuring separation of concerns

        mod.rs file is created in it as it will export the modules for main.rs to use, just by referencing the system module


        Next we create ball.rs which contains systems related to the ball's behaviour, like spawning, movement, and scoring detection

        And paddle.rs contains systems for input from player one and player two

        scoreboard.rs handles the systems related to the scoreboard, such as updating and displaying scores

        collision.rs contains systems that detect collisions and interaction between the ball and paddles

        Next, in the src directory, a bundles.rs is made.  This defines the entity bundles, which are components that are frequently used together.  For example, a ball bundle might include ball, position

        using these bundles helps streamline entity creation, ensuring that all the required components are included

        lastly, there is constants.rs which contains the constant values used throughout the game, like speed, dimension, other config settings we might need.  Having them centralized here helps to change the values and making sure it propagates throughout the code base from one place.


        This program structure allows us to break down the modules according to their functionality

        By separating components, system and bundles, it means that each file has a clear responsibility and it helps manage complexity, and reduces likelihood of errors

        This will be really useful as the game grows in complexity,

        and new features and systems can be added without disrupting the existing code that much
