/*

    NOTE:

        this project was made following a video course that is from 2020, so it was using an older version of actix that is so far behind the new current version that the syntax won't compile in the new version, and the old version's dependencies are no longer available (ring 0.12.0), so for now it only seems possible to code along with this and have it as a way to learn examples of how web servers run, even though actix itself seems to have changed from what this is shown to be like

        it is not expected that this server can compile or run or anything, but the code blocks can still be read and understood for general knowledge about web applications or at least how they were in 2020

*/

/*
    Note 2:

        the video course about websockets used the following code to demonstrate that an actix server could be started up, but it ended up removing all of this main function content and it replaced it with some other kind of thing that seemed to be needed to make the websockets work

    Note 3:

    The following is what was written out for the websocket main.rs file by lesson 12


    It has an asynchronous function to handle the incoming WebSocket connection requests

    it creates a websocket actor instance for every connection that is available,

    and starts WebSocket session for each of them

    and connects to the main server


    It will be an 'Actix' web application,

        it starts with an http request from a client and then elevates the connected user to WebSocket type conneciton
