    // when you preallocate 10 elements of space in the hash map, it might actually get 14

    // or when I got 1000 it showed 1732 or so

    // it has to do with the way the allocation algorithm works but it wasn't explained more than that

    // also, when iterating over the hashmap, the elements will not necessarily appear in the same order as they were inserted

    // this is because a hashmap is an unodered data structure

    // the order is determined by the hashing function and how the keys are distributed across the buckets

    // so the order they appear in reflects the order of how they're stored in memory
