        Option enum:

            a way to handle potentially null or missing values with something that is able to represent it while not actually being null, avoiding crashes

        Result enum:

            a way to handle things that might potentially succeed or fail, where they can be detected and handled without crashing the program




        the code was to make a 'divide_by' function that gives none if you use 0 as the divisor

        and a read_file that returns Ok(filecontentsstring) if valid filename and Err(string) if not valid file name, the return type of that function was Result<String, String>

        they were very self explanatory after having seen about Option and Result enums elsewhere a few times
