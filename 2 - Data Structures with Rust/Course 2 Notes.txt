This course has about 11-12 videos that talk about:

Built in rust data structures

Vector,
Hashmap


data structures we will implement directly

stack

queue



and it will talk about options and result enums a bit


Rather than talking too deeply about the data structures in a theoretical sense, it will be more about practical use of them in rust programming to know what a good elegant solution is for a given use case rather than making cumbersome suboptimal code



I've done up to the part about stacks and queues at the time of writing this line, and I wonder how are they going to be implemented?  The first thought I had was just taking a vector and using push and pop for the stack, and push and shift for a queue

rust vectors do have a push and 'remove(0)' that would work in that way

Now I want to see the videos and see if they do that or if they do something else that is more efficient or something like that

... starting the video, the first sentence says that stacks will be implemented using vectors
