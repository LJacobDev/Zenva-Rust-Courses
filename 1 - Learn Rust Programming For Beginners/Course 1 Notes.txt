This course is something I'll likely just watch without coding along because it covers things that I'm already familiar with.

I might still work through the code that the course works with just as practice, or may include parts that were of interest that I wanted to look at more closely.


rust-analyzer needs vscode to be open to the folder of a given project in order to work on it, so this root folder can be used to produce project folders and then open those project folders in additional vscode instances
