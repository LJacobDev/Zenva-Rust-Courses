This course is something I'll likely just watch without coding along because it covers things that I'm already familiar with.

I might still work through the code that the course works with just as practice, or may include parts that were of interest that I wanted to look at more closely.


rust-analyzer needs vscode to be open to the folder of a given project in order to work on it, so this root folder can be used to produce project folders and then open those project folders in additional vscode instances



I've completed this course, and there is a certificate that I can get and put on linkedin or download as (probably) PDF

I tried to download it but instead of showing my name it showed some alphanumeric value and I didn't go any further into trying to correct that because a certificate about beginner into to rust isn't super important to show right now, it undersells me if anything and if I were going to show a certificate I'd want one that looks more important or advanced
